            Hi! My name is Bibek and I enjoy developing products that provide
            intuitive and better user experience. My interest in web development
            started back when I first customized my own custom profiles in
            Tumblr. Although I have scrapped that account due to embarrassment
            but making the profile look the way I want it to made me realize I
            enjoy creating websites that look pleasing.

            Today, I am equipped with an arsenal (Fun fact: My favorite soccer
            team) of technologies that allow me to create modern and clean
            looking websites. My primary focus on any project is user experience
            â€“ making it as easy as possible for the user to achieve their
            desired result with the website.

            I specialize in full stack development using MERN tech stack along
            with other technologies such as Next.js, GraphQL and Tailwind (Fun
            fact: Taught myself all these cool technologies). So, I can work
            from designing stunning UI at the front end using React or Next
            along with Tailwind to designing a database at the backend using
            MongoDB and designing endpoints using REST or creating queries using
            GraphQL.
