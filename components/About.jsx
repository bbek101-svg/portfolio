            Hi! My name is Bibek and I enjoy developing products that provide
            intuitive and better user experience. My interest in web development
            started back when I first customized my own custom profiles in
            Tumblr. Although I have scrapped that account dude to embarrassment
            but making the profile look the way I want it to make me realize I
            enjoy creating websites that look pleasing.
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Today, I am equipped with an arsenal (Fun fact: my favorite soccer
            team) of technologies that allow me to create modern and clean
            looking websites. My primary focus on any project is user experience
            â€“ making it as easy as possible to the user to achieve their desired
            result with the website.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I specialize in full stack development using MERN tech stack along
            with other technologies such as Next.js, GraphQ and Tailwind (Fun
            fact: taught myself all these technologies). So I can work from
            designing stunning UI at the front end using React or Next along
            with Tailwind to designing a database at the backend using MongoDB
            and designing endpoints using REST or creating queries using
            GraphQL.
